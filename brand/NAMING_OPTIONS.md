# SKAI Agents — Naming Options (with competitor checks)

## Context

We need a name that signals reliability, structure, and AI capability without sounding gimmicky. Must work globally, be pronounceable, and support a `.com` domain for the main brand site.

## Competitor Landscape (indicative)

- OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere — model providers; neutral, institutional tone.
- LangChain, LlamaIndex — developer frameworks; descriptive, technical.
- Retell, Adept, Assembly, Perplexity — single-word/verb-style brands.
- AgentOps, Fixie, CrewAI, AutoGen — agent-focused tools; sometimes playful/technical.
- Airbyte, Segment, Postman — integration/API tooling; simple, functional names.

Observation: The space splits between institutional names (model layer) and playful/technical names (agent tooling). There’s room for a serious, structured brand signaling contracts and reliability.

## Name Options

1. SKAI Agents (current)

- Pros: Ownable, descriptive, aligns with product truth; SKAI can stand for "Structured Knowledge AI" (optional, not required in public copy). Works with sub-brands (SKAI Docs, SKAI Console).
- Cons: Two-word lockup; requires consistent styling to avoid acronym confusion.

2. SKAI Platform

- Pros: Broader umbrella; supports multiple products.
- Cons: Less specific; loses “agents” clarity.

3. SKAI Contract

- Pros: Directly signals JSON-first contracts.
- Cons: Narrow; might limit perception beyond schemas.

4. SKAI Orchestrate

- Pros: Conveys routing and reliability.
- Cons: Longer, verb-noun hybrid; less crisp in URL/wordmark.

5. SKAI Structured

- Pros: Emphasizes structured outputs.
- Cons: Adjective as brand core can feel generic.

## Domain Considerations

- skai-agents.com — available and descriptive for go-to-market.
- skai.com — likely unavailable/high-cost; not required.
- Consider owner domains for docs: docs.skai-agents.com; app.skai-agents.com.

## Trademark & Search

- "SKAI" has unrelated uses, but "SKAI Agents" is distinct in AI SaaS.
- Low collision risk with major AI brands; continue with counsel if scaling to multiple regions.

## Recommendation

- Primary: Keep "SKAI Agents" as the market-facing product brand.
- Rationale: It communicates the core (agents) and the differentiator (structured/contract-first) when paired with messaging. It balances institutional credibility (SKAI) with product clarity (Agents).
- Execution: Use "SKAI" as master brand; "SKAI Agents" as product line. Maintain wordmark consistency: "SKAI Agents" with equal or slightly heavier weight on "SKAI".

## Style Notes

- Capitalization: "SKAI Agents" (Title Case).
- Abbreviation: Avoid pronouncing letter-by-letter in marketing; write out the full name.
- Short handles: "SKAI" (brand), "Agents" (product) only in contexts with prior definition.

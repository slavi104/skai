# SKAI Agents — Voice & Tone

## Tone Pillars

- Professional & Clear: Use precise language, unambiguous terms, and avoid hype.
- Trustworthy & Responsible: Emphasize reliability, validation, observability, and controls.
- Practical & Helpful: Focus on outcomes, integrations, and developer experience.
- Forward-Looking, Not Flashy: Confident about AI progress without buzzword excess.

## Formality Balance

- Overall: Professional and direct. Use active voice. Avoid slang.
- Readability: Short sentences, concrete nouns and verbs, specific benefits.
- International English: Avoid idioms and culture-specific humor.

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Prefer: schema, contract, validation, observability, credits, outputs, routing, guardrails.
- Avoid: magic, sorcery, black-box, hack, wizardry, “just works.”
- Replace hype with facts: latencies, SLAs, versioning, typing, test coverage.

## Structural Guidance

- Lead with value/outcome, then explain how.
- Use parallel structure and scannable lists.
- Name the audience when relevant (e.g., "platform teams", "ops leaders").

## Do/Don’t Examples

### Landing Page

- Do: "Define outputs as schemas. Receive validated JSON, every time."
- Don’t: "AI that magically understands your intent."

- Do: "Spin up agents with versioned prompts and enterprise guardrails."
- Don’t: "Launch AI assistants in minutes with zero effort."

### Product Pages

- Do: "Credit-based usage with per-project limits and reporting."
- Don’t: "Unlimited AI for everyone."

- Do: "Typed SDKs for Node, Python, and Go."
- Don’t: "Works with everything, no configuration needed."

### Docs & API

- Do: "Request must conform to `TaskSchema`. Server returns `ResultSchema` or validation errors."
- Don’t: "Send anything—our AI figures it out."

### Status & Reliability

- Do: "Automatic retries with idempotency keys; full trace available."
- Don’t: "We’ll try again and hope it works."

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`).
  You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) for managing multiple Node versions installed on a single machine.
- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version 9 or above (which can be checked by running `pnpm --version`)
- (Windows only) Install [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

#### Optional

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.11 (which can be checked by running `python3 --version`) and [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/#installation) version 2.3 or above (which can be checked by running
  `pdm --version`)
  - You need this one if you want to run `pdm install` command in `packages/backend` or `packages/workers` outside
    docker container
  - You can use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing multiple Python versions installed on a single machine.

### Fresh installation

#### Setup using CLI starter kit

You can use a special CLI tool to run a new local instance of the SaaS Boilerplate as soon as possible. It will clone
the repository and take care of setting up the environment. Run the following command in the directory where you would
like to create a new project:

**_Using `npm`:_**

```bash
npm init saas-boilerplate PATH
```

**_Using `pnpm`:_**

```bash
pnpm create saas-boilerplate PATH
```

**_Using `yarn`:_**

```bash
yarn create saas-boilerplate PATH
```

> :information_source: Where `PATH` is a directory name where to initialize project.
>
> :warning: **The init directory needs to be empty!**

#### Manual setup

## How was the SaaS Boilerplate created?

In our experience in Apptension, we have built hundreds of web and mobile applications over the years and saw a bunch of standard features. For example, all applications (or at least 99% of them) need a login, email templating, payments and subscriptions, CMS integration, and more.

A broader list of elements that can be implemented in projects in this way was created after building dozens of different types of SaaS products. We analyzed them and noticed many common parts appeared virtually unchanged. So we created SaaS Boilerplate that is the base, and while it requires design or functional customization for a specific SaaS product, it dramatically reduces development time.

That's why you don't have to start by writing the code for that login or payment function. Instead, you can use off-the-shelf elements in those places and focus on creating the rest of the features unique to the project.

The development process is ongoing as we continually add new features and improve existing ones. We started with AWS Boilerplate, which evolved into the current SaaS Boilerplate. It originally contained only infrastructure (a configured AWS account) and was a template for the project, which had blanks for the back-end and front-end.

We saw that it was already a handy and very well-received tool, so the next natural step was to add more elements to it ‚Äì front-end, back-end, and pack the relevant features that were most often repeated in different projects, including logging, CRUD, payments, integration with content pool, etc.

Our idea was that it shouldn't be just the code itself because SaaS Boilerplate also contains our know-how ‚Äì because we gathered everything needed for development and around development in one package. So you don't have to think about choosing code formatting, matching different tools and their subsequent configuration, etc. Moreover, such a package is proven and battle-tested ‚Äì you can just upload it to the cloud and start so-called heavy development.

## Who are we?

We're [Apptension](https://apptension.com?utm_source=readme-file&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=SaaS%20Boilerplate&utm_term=SaaS%20Boilerplate), a team that turns ideas into world-class software using expertise in technology, design, and product management. We work with founders, investors, and creative agencies to help them bring uncommon ideas to the market.

## Brand

### SKAI Agents ‚Äî Brand Brief

#### Mission

Enable businesses to deploy trustworthy AI agents that deliver structured, validated results over a simple JSON-first API‚Äîso teams can automate creative and cognitive work without prompt chaos.

#### Vision

Become the default AI infrastructure layer for modern businesses, where every workflow that needs reasoning, generation, or decision-making is orchestrated reliably through SKAI Agents.

#### Brand Values

- Reliability: Production-grade guarantees, predictable outputs, and enforced contracts.
- Clarity: JSON-first design, explicit schemas, and transparent observability.
- Trust & Security: Enterprise controls, privacy-first operations, and auditability.
- Developer Empathy: Simple SDKs, great docs, and fast integration paths.

- Interoperability: Works with your stack‚Äîwebhooks, queues, and third-party APIs.

#### Positioning Statement

For product and platform teams who need predictable AI automation in production, SKAI Agents is the JSON-first AI agents platform that abstracts prompt engineering behind schemas and contracts. Unlike generic LLM wrappers or prompt tools, SKAI enforces structure with validation, provides credit-based controls, and offers simple SDKs so you can ship AI capabilities without fragile prompts or inconsistent outputs.

#### Key Differentiators

- JSON-First Contracts: Define inputs/outputs as schemas; receive structured data by default.
- Schema Validation: Enforced at runtime with typed SDKs to prevent malformed responses.
- Zero Prompt Chaos: Versioned templates, guardrails, and deterministic orchestration.
- Credit-Based Metering: Predictable spend controls per org, project, or environment.
- Simple SDKs: Lightweight clients for quick start and strong typing in common languages.
- Observability: Traces, logs, test harnesses, and drift detection for continuous quality.
- Model Choice & Routing: Use best-in-class models with routing and fallback strategies.
- Enterprise-Ready: Audit trails, access controls, and environment isolation.
- Integration-Ready: Webhooks, queues, CRM/CMS connectors, and first-class REST/JSON.

#### Why It Matters (Outcomes)

- Faster Shipping: Go from idea to production without building bespoke prompt tooling.
- Lower Risk: Contracts, validation, and guardrails reduce failures and rework.
- Lower Cost: Credit-based usage and efficient routing optimize spend.
- Better UX: Reliable, structured responses power consistent product experiences.

#### Audience

- B2B product teams, agencies, and operations leaders integrating AI at scale.
- Engineering leaders who need safe, observable AI in regulated or data-sensitive environments.

#### Brand Personality

Professional, trustworthy, and forward-looking. Helpful and precise‚Äînot playful, not hype-driven. Communicates substance over spectacle.

### SKAI Agents ‚Äî Identity Starter

#### Color Palette (Accessible, Professional)

- Primary ‚Äî Deep Blue: `#0A2A43` (WCAG-friendly on white; evokes trust/tech)
- Secondary ‚Äî Electric Indigo: `#5A6FF7` (accents, CTAs; check contrast on dark)
- Accent ‚Äî Teal: `#1BB5A6` (success/active states; sparing use)
- Warning ‚Äî Amber: `#FFB020`
- Danger ‚Äî Crimson: `#D6455D`
- Neutrals
  - Ink: `#0B1320`
  - Graphite: `#2C3440`
  - Slate: `#4B5563`
  - Ash: `#6B7280`
  - Mist: `#9CA3AF`
  - Cloud: `#E5E7EB`
  - Snow: `#F9FAFB`

Guideline: Maintain AA contrast (4.5:1 for body text). Reserve `#5A6FF7` for buttons/links with dark text on light backgrounds or white text on deep blue.

#### Typography (Google Fonts Only)

- Headings: Inter (700/600) ‚Äî geometric, modern, excellent on web UIs.
- Body: Inter (400/500) ‚Äî high readability; consider optical size.
- Mono (code): JetBrains Mono (400/600) ‚Äî for code, JSON, CLI snippets.

Fallback stack examples:

- Headings/Body: `Inter, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif`
- Mono: `"JetBrains Mono", SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, monospace`

Type scale (starter):

- H1: 36‚Äì44px / 1.2
- H2: 28‚Äì32px / 1.25
- H3: 22‚Äì24px / 1.3
- Body: 16‚Äì18px / 1.6
- Mono: 14‚Äì16px / 1.5

#### Logo Concept Directions

1. Contract Mark (JSON Bracket)

- Bracketed "S" or agent node within `{ }`, signaling schema/contracts.
- Rationale: Owns JSON-first territory visually. Works as favicon.

2. Signal Grid (Agent Network)

- Modular nodes forming a subtle "A" or "S"; conveys routing/reliability.
- Rationale: Speaks to orchestration, model choice, and fallbacks.

3. Forward Pointer (Deterministic Flow)

- Angular arrow/chevron built from right-angle segments (like brackets).
- Rationale: Progress, direction, and structure (no chaos).

Wordmark

- Use a clean, geometric sans: Inter Bold or similar.
- Kerning slightly tightened; letterforms all-caps or Title Case: "SKAI Agents".
- Keep "SKAI" weight equal or slightly heavier than "Agents".

#### Visual Guidelines for Digital Use

- Layout: Generous whitespace, grid-based sections, scannable blocks.
- UI: Primary deep blue headers; indigo CTA buttons; neutral backgrounds.
- Components: Cards with 8‚Äì12px radius, 1px neutral borders, subtle shadows.
- Data: Prefer neutral backgrounds with high-contrast code blocks.
- Icons: Outline icons with 2px stroke; avoid playful/rounded cartoon styles.
- Illustration: Abstract, geometric motifs; avoid 3D mascots.
- Accessibility: Enforce AA/AAA; test link/CTA contrast; focus states visible.

#### Usage Examples

- Buttons: Primary (indigo) on white with white text; hover darken by 6‚Äì8%.
- Sections: Dark hero on deep blue with white text; supporting indigo/teal accents.
- Docs: Light theme default; monospace for JSON; copy-to-clipboard visible.

#### Asset Starter Checklist

- Favicon: `{}` monogram in deep blue/white.
- Social: 1200√ó630 banners with bracket monogram and tagline.
- Icons: 16‚Äì512px sizes, consistent stroke.
- Logo lockups: Horizontal, stacked, and monogram-only.

### 1) Title & Executive Summary

This document describes the production architecture for our multi-tenant AI SaaS JSON API built on Node.js + TypeScript using Fastify, Postgres with Row Level Security (RLS), and pg-boss for job orchestration (no RabbitMQ). We enforce strong tenancy isolation using Postgres RLS with `current_setting('app.account_id', true)` scoping set per-connection/transaction. The system processes asynchronous generation jobs through a provider adapter layer (OpenAI first), guarantees idempotent POSTs, delivers outbound webhooks, and powers usage dashboards from immutable ledgers. Credit-based billing integrates Stripe; Stripe events convert to credits via ledgers and trigger webhooks. The platform emphasizes minimal dependencies, PII-safe structured logs via pino redact, rate limits, API key rotation, and DLQs for failed jobs and webhooks.

Responsibilities

- HTTP API (Fastify):

  - Exposes JSON-only `/v1` endpoints.
  - Authenticates via bearer API keys, enforces scopes, rate limits.
  - Validates payloads, computes canonical body hash, enforces idempotent POSTs.
  - Sets `set_config('app.account_id', ...)` per transaction; all queries scoped by RLS.
  - Enqueues pg-boss jobs and returns 202/201 with resource references.

- Worker processes:

  - Subscribe to pg-boss queues with least-privilege DB role.
  - Set `set_config('app.account_id', ...)` before tenant data access.
  - Call provider adapters (OpenAI first), write ledger entries, emit outbound events.
  - Export health/ready endpoints and metrics.

- Provider Adapter layer:

  - Normalizes calls to third-party LLM providers behind a stable interface.
  - Handles retries, timeouts (AbortController), and error mapping.
  - Does not decide pricing; pricing‚Üícredits occurs in service code.

- Postgres (primary + pg-boss schema):

  - Single source of truth with strict RLS for multi-tenancy isolation.
  - Stores jobs, job events, credits ledger, webhooks, Stripe dedupe state.
  - Hosts pg-boss tables in dedicated schema (e.g., `boss`).

- Webhook dispatcher:

  - Delivers signed JSON POSTs with HMAC, retries with exponential backoff.
  - Maintains delivery attempts and DLQ on permanent failure.

- Metrics/usage dashboards:

  - Materialized and standard views over `usage_rollups_daily` and events.
  - Surface KPIs: credit balance, credits/day, job latency, error rate, webhook success.

- Logging/observability:

  - PII-safe structured logs (pino) with redaction of sensitive JSON paths.
  - Correlates `request_id`, `account_id`, `job_id`, and timings across API and workers.

RLS Policy Pattern

```sql

ALTER TABLE app.accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.api_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.jobs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.job_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

ALTER TABLE app.stripe_customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.stripe_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE app.usage_rollups_daily ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

```

Roles

```sql
-- Roles
CREATE ROLE app_api NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE app_worker NOINHERIT;
CREATE ROLE app_migrator NOINHERIT;

-- Privileges (example subset)
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA app TO app_api, app_worker, app_migrator;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON app.idempotency_keys TO app_api;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON app.credits_ledger TO app_worker;

-- Ensure all access is gated by RLS
ALTER TABLE app.jobs FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

Connection scoping examples

Fastify request handler (transaction-scoped account):

```ts
// Fastify route handler outline
fastify.post(
  '/v1/jobs/generations',
  { preHandler: [authn, rateLimit, idempotency] },
  async (req, reply) => {
    const accountId = req.user.accountId; // from API key auth
    const client = await pgPool.connect();
    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');
      await client.query("SELECT set_config('app.account_id', $1, true)", [
        accountId,
      ]);
      // All subsequent queries are RLS-scoped
      const { rows } = await client.query(
        'INSERT INTO app.jobs (id, account_id, type, status, idempotency_key) VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), $1, $2, $3, $4) RETURNING id',
        [
          accountId,
          'generation.create',
          'queued',
          req.headers['idempotency-key'],
        ],
      );
      await enqueueGenerationCreate(rows[0].id, accountId);
      await client.query('COMMIT');
      return reply.code(202).send({ job_id: rows[0].id });
    } catch (err) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      throw err;
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  },
);
```

Worker sets session account context before touching tenant rows:

```ts
async function withAccountContext<T>(
  client: PoolClient,
  accountId: string,
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
): Promise<T> {
  await client.query("SELECT set_config('app.account_id', $1, true)", [
    accountId,
  ]);
  return fn();
}
```

### 4) Core Runtime Flows (Mermaid sequenceDiagram)

Async generation job

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant A as Fastify API
    participant DB as Postgres (RLS)
    participant Q as pg-boss
    participant W as Worker
    participant P as OpenAI Adapter
    participant WH as Webhook Dispatcher

    C->>A: POST /v1/jobs/generations (Idempotency-Key)
    A->>DB: BEGIN; set_config(app.account_id)
    A->>DB: Insert idempotency row (unique)
    A->>DB: Reserve credits (pending)
    A->>Q: enqueue generation.create(job_id, account_id)
    A-->>C: 202 Accepted {job_id}
    W->>Q: subscribe generation.create
    W->>DB: set_config(app.account_id)
    W->>P: create chat completion
    P-->>W: result or error
    W->>DB: finalize ledger (+/- delta)
    W->>DB: update job status (succeeded/failed)
    W->>WH: emit job.completed/job.failed
    WH->>DB: record webhook_delivery
    WH-->>Client Endpoint: Signed POST
```

Step-by-step:

1. API authenticates, enforces idempotency by key + body hash.
2. Reserves estimated credits in `credits_ledger` as pending.
3. Enqueues `generation.create` with job + account context.
4. Worker calls OpenAI via adapter, then finalizes credits: confirm or refund.
5. Webhook dispatcher posts signed events to subscribed endpoints.

Stripe credit grant

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant S as Stripe
    participant A as Fastify API (/internal/stripe/webhook)
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant Q as pg-boss
    participant W as Worker
    participant WH as Webhook Dispatcher

    S->>A: POST event (signature)
    A->>A: Verify signature + dedupe by stripe_event_id
    A->>DB: Store stripe_event (idempotent)
    A->>Q: enqueue billing.credit_grant(account_id, amount)
    W->>Q: subscribe billing.credit_grant
    W->>DB: set_config(app.account_id)
    W->>DB: Insert credits_ledger (+amount, reason='stripe')
    W->>DB: Mark stripe_event processed
    W->>WH: Emit credits.granted
    WH-->>Customer Endpoint: Signed POST
```

Step-by-step:

1. Stripe webhook verified and deduped; event stored.
2. A background job grants credits in the ledger.
3. A webhook notifies the tenant of new credits.

Webhook delivery

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant D as Webhook Dispatcher
    participant DB as Postgres
    participant Q as pg-boss
    participant EP as Customer Endpoint

    D->>Q: enqueue webhook.delivery(delivery_id)
    D->>DB: Fetch endpoint + payload
    D->>EP: Signed POST with HMAC
    alt 2xx
        D->>DB: Mark success
    else non-2xx/timeout
        D->>Q: retry with backoff
        D->>DB: attempts++ / last_attempt_at
    end
    opt exceeded retries
        D->>DB: Move to DLQ + mark failed
    end
```

Step-by-step:

1. Each delivery is a separate job with its own retry policy.
2. Signed requests carry `X-Webhook-Signature` and `X-Delivery-Id`.
3. Exhausted retries write to DLQ for manual re-drive.

### 5) Job Queue Strategy (pg-boss)

Queues

- `generation.create`
- `webhook.delivery`
- `billing.credit_grant`

Defaults

- Retries: 5
- Backoff: exponential with jitter [5s, 15s, 45s, 2m, 5m]
- TTL per queue: configurable (e.g., `GENERATION_JOB_TTL=30m`, `WEBHOOK_TTL=2h`, `BILLING_TTL=2h`)
- Concurrency: env-driven per queue
- DLQ naming: `<queue>.dlq`

Worker bootstrap plan

1. Load config; connect as least-privilege role `app_worker`.
2. Register pg-boss handlers for each queue; expose `/healthz` and `/readyz`.
3. Implement graceful shutdown: stop accepting, drain, ack/fail outstanding.
4. Emit metrics: processed, failures, durations, queue depth.

TypeScript pseudo-implementation

```ts
import PgBoss from 'pg-boss';
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import pino from 'pino';

const log = pino({ level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info' });

export async function startWorker() {
  const pool = new Pool({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    application_name: 'worker',
  });
  const boss = new PgBoss({
    connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    schema: process.env.PG_BOSS_SCHEMA || 'boss',
    onComplete: true,
  });
  await boss.start();

  const handler = async (job: any) => {
    const start = Date.now();
    const { account_id: accountId } = job.data;
    const client = await pool.connect();
    try {
      await client.query('BEGIN');
      await client.query("SELECT set_config('app.account_id', $1, true)", [
        accountId,
      ]);
      if (job.name === 'generation.create') {
        await handleGenerationCreate(client, job.data);
      } else if (job.name === 'billing.credit_grant') {
        await handleCreditGrant(client, job.data);
      } else if (job.name === 'webhook.delivery') {
        await handleWebhookDelivery(client, job.data);
      }
      await client.query('COMMIT');
      await boss.complete(job.id);
      log.info(
        { job_id: job.id, queue: job.name, duration_ms: Date.now() - start },
        'processed',
      );
    } catch (err: any) {
      await client.query('ROLLBACK');
      log.error({ err, job_id: job.id, queue: job.name }, 'failed');
      await boss.fail(job.id, err);
    } finally {
      client.release();
    }
  };

  await boss.subscribe(
    'generation.create',
    { teamSize: Number(process.env.Q_GEN_CREATE_CONCURRENCY || 5) },
    handler,
  );
  await boss.subscribe(
    'billing.credit_grant',
    { teamSize: Number(process.env.Q_BILLING_GRANT_CONCURRENCY || 2) },
    handler,
  );
  await boss.subscribe(
    'webhook.delivery',
    { teamSize: Number(process.env.Q_WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_CONCURRENCY || 5) },
    handler,
  );
}
```

### 6) Provider Adapter Layer

Rationale: The adapter isolates provider-specific payloads, errors, and timeouts, enabling vendor swaps and consistent metering. It exposes a minimal, typed surface that returns normalized results and usage metadata. Pricing-to-credits mapping occurs outside the adapter in service code to keep pricing policy independent of provider behavior.

Interfaces (types only)

```ts
export type GenerationInput = {
  model: string;
  messages: Array<{ role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant'; content: string }>;
  temperature?: number;
  maxTokens?: number;
  accountId: string; // for auditing only
  requestId: string;
  timeoutMs?: number;
};

export type GenerationResult = {
  id: string;
  outputText: string;
  provider: 'openai';
  model: string;
  latencyMs: number;
  usage: {
    promptTokens: number;
    completionTokens: number;
    totalTokens: number;
  };
  raw?: unknown;
};

export class ProviderError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly code:
      | 'RATE_LIMIT'
      | 'TIMEOUT'
      | 'SERVER_ERROR'
      | 'BAD_REQUEST',
    public readonly status: number,
    public readonly details?: unknown,
  ) {
    super(message);
  }
}

export interface ProviderAdapter {
  generate(
    input: GenerationInput,
    abort: AbortSignal,
  ): Promise<GenerationResult>;
}
```

OpenAI first

- Endpoint: Chat Completions (`POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`).
- Error mapping: HTTP 429‚Üí`RATE_LIMIT`, 5xx‚Üí`SERVER_ERROR`, 408/timeout‚Üí`TIMEOUT`, 4xx‚Üí`BAD_REQUEST`.
- Timeout: use `AbortController` with `timeoutMs` default 30s.
- Pricing‚Üícredits: applied by service code after `GenerationResult.usage` using static mapping in `/docs/CREDIT_MODEL.md`.

### 7) Credits & Idempotency (link to other docs)

Credits lifecycle

- Reservation: on job accept, insert a pending ledger entry with estimated cost.
- Finalization: worker replaces pending with actual cost; delta posted as new ledger entries (confirm or refund).
- Invariants: ledger is append-only; balance = sum(delta); no in-place updates.

Idempotency storage

- Keyed by `(account_id, method, path, idempotency_key)` with canonical `body_hash` (stable JSON stringify, sorted keys).
- TTL: 24h via `expires_at`; periodic job deletes expired rows.
- Conflict rules: same key + same `body_hash` returns saved response; same key + different `body_hash` ‚Üí 409 Conflict.

SQL schema snippet

```sql
CREATE TABLE app.idempotency_keys (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  account_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES app.accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  method text NOT NULL,
  path text NOT NULL,
  idempotency_key text NOT NULL,
  body_hash text NOT NULL,
  response_code int,
  response_body jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now() + interval '24 hours',
  UNIQUE(account_id, method, path, idempotency_key)
);
ALTER TABLE app.idempotency_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY rls_idem ON app.idempotency_keys FOR ALL USING (account_id = current_setting('app.account_id', true)::uuid) WITH CHECK (account_id = current_setting('app.account_id', true)::uuid);
```

Fastify preHandler outline

```ts
async function idempotency(req: any, reply: any) {
  const key = req.headers['idempotency-key'];
  if (!key) return; // only enforced on POST/PUT/PATCH as configured
  const method = req.method;
  const path = req.routerPath;
  const accountId = req.user.accountId;
  const bodyHash = canonicalJsonHash(req.body);
  const client = await pgPool.connect();
  try {
    await client.query('BEGIN');
    await client.query("SELECT set_config('app.account_id', $1, true)", [
      accountId,
    ]);
    const { rows } = await client.query(
      `INSERT INTO app.idempotency_keys (account_id, method, path, idempotency_key, body_hash)
       VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5)
       ON CONFLICT (account_id, method, path, idempotency_key) DO UPDATE SET account_id = EXCLUDED.account_id
       RETURNING response_code, response_body, body_hash`,
      [accountId, method, path, key, bodyHash],
    );
    const idem = rows[0];
    if (idem.response_code != null) {
      // Existing response
      return reply.code(idem.response_code).send(idem.response_body);
    }
    if (idem.body_hash !== bodyHash) {
      return reply.code(409).send({ error: 'IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CONFLICT' });
    }
    // Continue to handler; handler must update idempotency row with response
    (reply as any).onSend(async (_req: any, _reply: any, payload: any) => {
      await pgPool.query(
        'UPDATE app.idempotency_keys SET response_code=$1, response_body=$2 WHERE account_id=$3 AND method=$4 AND path=$5 AND idempotency_key=$6',
        [reply.statusCode, safeJson(payload), accountId, method, path, key],
      );
    });
    await client.query('COMMIT');
  } catch (e) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    throw e;
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

See `/docs/CREDIT_MODEL.md` for pricing‚Üícredits mapping and `/docs/API_SPEC.md` for endpoint semantics.

### 8) Security & Access Control (brief, with links)

- Bearer API keys: format `sk_live_<prefix>_<random>`, store only `key_prefix` and `key_hash` (argon2id or bcrypt), never the full secret. Rotation: create a new key, migrate clients, deactivate old key, soft-delete.
- Scopes: e.g., `jobs:write`, `jobs:read`, `webhooks:write`, `billing:read` attached per key.
- Rate limits: per key and endpoint; return `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` headers.
- CORS posture: machine-to-machine only; default deny; allowlist none by default.
- TLS/HSTS: HTTPS only, `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`.
- PII-safe logging: pino redact paths

```json
[
  "req.headers.authorization",
  "req.headers.cookie",
  "res.headers.set-cookie",
  "body.card",
  "body.password",
  "body.token",
  "user.email",
  "key_hash",
  "webhook_endpoints.secret"
]
```

See `/docs/SECURITY_BASELINE.md` for additional controls.

### 9) Webhooks (Outbound)

Event schema examples

```json
{
  "type": "job.completed",
  "data": { "job_id": "...", "account_id": "...", "latency_ms": 1234 }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "job.failed",
  "data": {
    "job_id": "...",
    "account_id": "...",
    "error": { "code": "RATE_LIMIT" }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "credits.granted",
  "data": { "amount": 1000, "account_id": "...", "source": "stripe" }
}
```

Signing

- Header: `X-Webhook-Signature: v1,t=<unix>,sig=<hmac_sha256(secret, t + '.' + body)>`
- Tolerance: ¬±5 minutes; reject if outside window or signature mismatch.

Idempotency for consumers

- Headers: `X-Delivery-Id` and `X-Delivery-Key` unique per delivery; consumers should dedupe on these.

Retry/DLQ policy

- Retries with exponential backoff and jitter (5s, 15s, 45s, 2m, 5m), up to 5 attempts.
- On exhaustion, mark delivery failed and copy to `webhook.delivery.dlq` for later redrive.

Webhook signing (Node.js example)

```ts
import crypto from 'node:crypto';

export function signWebhook(
  secret: string,
  body: string,
  nowSec = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
) {
  const payload = `${nowSec}.${body}`;
  const sig = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex');
  return { header: `v1,t=${nowSec},sig=${sig}`, timestamp: nowSec };
}
```

### 10) Observability & Usage Dashboards

Logging fields

- `request_id`, `account_id`, `job_id`, `queue`, `status`, `duration_ms`, `provider`, `model`.

SQL views driving dashboards

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW app.usage_rollups_daily AS
SELECT
  account_id,
  date_trunc('day', created_at) AS day,
  sum(CASE WHEN delta < 0 THEN -delta ELSE 0 END) AS credits_used,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE reason = 'generation') AS jobs_count,
  avg((job_events.payload->>'latency_ms')::int) AS avg_latency_ms,
  avg(CASE WHEN (job_events.name = 'job.failed') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float AS error_rate
FROM app.credits_ledger
LEFT JOIN app.job_events ON app.job_events.job_id = app.credits_ledger.job_id
GROUP BY account_id, day;
```

Minimal dashboard KPIs

- Balance (sum of `credits_ledger.delta`).
- Credits/day (from `usage_rollups_daily`).
- Job latency p50/p95, error rate.
- Webhook success rate.

### 11) Minimal Dependencies & Config

Runtime dependencies and rationale

- fastify: HTTP server, JSON-only API.
- pg: Postgres driver.
- pg-boss: queueing on Postgres (no RabbitMQ).
- pino: structured logging with redaction.
- zod (optional): payload validation.
- undici/native fetch: outbound HTTP (provider + webhooks).
- stripe: webhook verification utilities.

Safe defaults and failure modes

- Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`: generation jobs fail fast with `SERVER_ERROR` and no credit deduction (refund pending reservations).
- Missing `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Stripe endpoint disabled at startup.
- Absent rate limit config: default token bucket used and headers emitted.

### 12) Failure, Backpressure & Resilience

Scenarios

- Provider outage: workers backoff (retry policy); credit reservations refunded on failure; circuit-break after N failures.
- Stripe outage: webhook verifications may delay; events stored and processed later; idempotency ensures no double grants.
- Postgres degraded: API returns 503 for write-heavy endpoints; workers reduce concurrency; queues back up.
- Queue backlog: adjust `teamSize` concurrency; API may apply admission control (429) based on balance and queue depth.
- Webhook targets down: retries with backoff; after 5 attempts, move to DLQ with manual redrive.

Backpressure knobs

- Concurrency per queue, global in-flight limits, request timeouts, payload size caps (Fastify `bodyLimit`).

Non-goals in V1 and Future work

- No RabbitMQ (Postgres + pg-boss only).
- No multi-provider fallback; OpenAI only initially.
- No streaming responses; consider later.
- No tools or function-calling.
- No SSO for dashboard; consider in V2.
- No regional isolation; single region V1.

  USING (account_id = current_setting('app.account_id', true)::uuid)
  WITH CHECK (account_id = current_setting('app.account_id', true)::uuid);
```

Glossary

- Account: Tenant boundary; all data scoped by `account_id`.
- RLS: Row Level Security in Postgres enforcing per-tenant isolation.
- pg-boss: Queueing library storing jobs in Postgres.
- DLQ: Dead Letter Queue for failed jobs/deliveries.
- Idempotency: Property ensuring repeated POSTs with same key+body yield the same effect.
- Adapter: Abstraction layer over providers like OpenAI.
